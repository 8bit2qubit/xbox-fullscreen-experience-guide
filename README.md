### Step 1: Upgrade to Windows 11 Dev Channel Build (26220.6690+)

Enabling the Xbox fullscreen experience requires a specific Dev Channel build or newer.

#### 1. Understand the Dev Channel Commitment

Joining the Dev Channel is a significant technical commitment. Builds in the Dev Channel are often unstable. The only supported method to revert to a stable build is a clean installation of Windows, which will erase all data on the installation drive. Opting out of the program via Settings will not roll back your system to a stable version.

#### 2. Join the Windows Insider Program

* Navigate to the official [Windows Insider Program website](https://insider.windows.com/). Sign in with your Microsoft account to register and accept the program agreement.
* On your Windows 11 PC, open **Settings** and navigate to **Windows Update** > **Windows Insider Program**.
* Click **Get started** and link your registered Microsoft account.

#### 3. Switch to the Dev Channel and Initiate Upgrade

* When prompted to choose a channel, select **Dev Channel**.
* Acknowledge the risk warnings and restart your computer when prompted.
* After restarting, navigate to **Settings** > **Windows Update** and click **Check for updates**.
* The system will begin to download and install the latest Dev Channel build. This process can be lengthy and may require multiple restarts.

#### 4. Verify Your System Build

Once the update is complete, verify your OS build by navigating to **Settings** > **System** > **About**. Confirm that the **OS build** is `26220.6690` or higher.

#### 2. Install the Tool

Execute the downloaded installer. Administrator privileges are required; follow the on-screen prompts to complete the installation.

#### 3. Run the Activation Process

* Click the **Enable Xbox Fullscreen Experience** button in the application's main window.
* **Restart** your computer as prompted to apply the changes.

#### 4. Restoration Process
